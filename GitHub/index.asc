= A Brief Introduction to Git
Gabriel de Melo Souza

== Objective ==

This page is made for beginners who just started using Git via terminal, and is nothing more than a quick introduction. For further reading and knowledge visit the Git https://git-scm.com[main page]

Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git[^1^].

== Installing Git ==

Initiate your linux machine, and open terminal by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+T]. After the terminal is opened, type the following command:
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo apt-get install git
----

== Starting a Repository ==
Git is divided in repositories, for better organizing your projects. Usually a repository contains only one project. To get a user page in github.io, we have to make a folder named user.github.io, and then start the repository. 

There's an easier way, that is log in into github.com and clone the repository. To clone the repository we acess it via github.com and click the green button, as the following:

For the page to be acessible online, we need to have a index.html file in the main folder of the user.github.io repository.

== Adding Your Files To GitHub ==
To add files to your Git repository, just add them to the folder you created.
